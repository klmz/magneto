Magneto
=======

Magneto is a chat robot written in Java. It works over the Jabber xmpp protocol. At [Magnet.me](https://github.com/orgs/Magnetme/) we use it to connect to HipChat but it is capable of other chat services as well.

Get started using Magneto by cloning the [Project skeleton](https://github.com/Magnetme/magneto-skeleton)


### Diversion from Magnet.me
The original creators from Magnet.me (props to them) decided to no longer support one-to-one communcations, 
I included that in this version because this is needed for communication over Facebook or Google Talk.
It should still be fully compatible with HipChat and Slack in the way it is used at Magnet.me
