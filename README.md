Magneto
=======

Magneto is a chat robot written in Java. It works over the Jabber xmpp protocol. At [Magnet.me](https://github.com/orgs/Magnetme/) we use it to connect to HipChat but it is capable of other chat services as well.

Get started using Magneto by cloning the [Project skeleton](https://github.com/Magnetme/magneto-skeleton)
