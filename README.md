Magneto
=======

Magneto is a chat robot written in Java. It works over the Jabber xmpp protocol. At Magnet.me we use it to connect to HipChat but it is capable of other chat services as well.

Get started using Magneto by cloning the [Project skeleton](https://github.com/Magnetme/magneto-skeleton)
